## E-Commerce Website (MERN Stack)

**Description:**

This repository contains the source code for a user-friendly and secure e-commerce website developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and Tailwind CSS. The project prioritizes a seamless user experience for customers while ensuring robust security measures to protect user data.

**Features:**

* **Secure User Accounts:**
    * User registration and login with secure password hashing (e.g., bcrypt)
* **Product Management:**
    * Product browsing with filtering by category and brand
* **Shopping Cart Functionality:**
    * Add, remove, and modify items in the shopping cart
* (Optional: Include additional features like checkout process, payment integration, user reviews, etc. based on your project's scope)

**Prerequisites:**

* Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system
* MongoDB database (local or cloud-based)

**Installation:**

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd <your-repo-name>
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install  # or yarn install
   ```

**Configuration (if applicable):**

* Create a `.env` file in the project root directory to store sensitive environment variables (e.g., database connection string, API keys). Include instructions on how to populate this file.

**Running the Application:**

1. Start the back-end server:

   ```bash
   npm run server  # or yarn start:server
   ```

2. Start the front-end development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev 
   ```

   This will typically launch the front-end application at `http://localhost:3000` (or a different port depending on your setup)
